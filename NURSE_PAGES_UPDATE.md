# Nurse Pages Implementation Update

## Overview

Created missing nurse pages for medication-schedule and vital-signs functionality, updated navigation routes, and ensured proper integration with the QuickActions system.

## New Components Created

### 1. MedicationSchedule.js (`/src/pages/nurse/MedicationSchedule.js`)

- **Purpose**: Manage patient medication administration and scheduling
- **Features**:
  - Medication list with status tracking (Pending, Administered, Overdue)
  - Priority-based alerts for overdue medications
  - Comprehensive medication details dialog
  - Administration tracking with timestamps and notes
  - Patient safety information (allergies, notes)
  - Summary cards showing medication statistics
- **Mock Data**: 5 patients with various medication types and schedules

### 2. VitalSigns.js (`/src/pages/nurse/VitalSigns.js`)

- **Purpose**: Monitor and record patient vital signs throughout the day
- **Features**:
  - Vital signs table with normal range indicators
  - Color-coded status indicators (normal, high, low)
  - Comprehensive vital signs recording dialog
  - Normal ranges reference guide
  - Patient safety alerts for abnormal vitals
  - Summary cards showing vital signs statistics
- **Vital Signs Tracked**: Temperature, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Oxygen Saturation, Pain Level

## Updated Navigation

### 1. AppRoutes.js Updates

- Added imports for new nurse components
- Added new routes:
  - `/nurse/medication-schedule` → MedicationSchedule component
  - `/nurse/vital-signs` → VitalSigns component

### 2. QuickActions.js Updates

- Updated nurse routes to use separate dedicated pages instead of shared route
- Each nurse action now navigates to its specific functionality:
  - `medication-schedule` → `/nurse/medication-schedule`
  - `vital-signs` → `/nurse/vital-signs`
  - `patient-care` → `/nurse/patient-care-tasks` (existing)

## Nurse QuickActions Navigation

All three nurse actions now have dedicated pages:

1. **Patient Care Tasks** → `/nurse/patient-care-tasks`

   - General nursing tasks and assignments
   - Task completion tracking
   - Patient care notes

2. **Medication Schedule** → `/nurse/medication-schedule`

   - Medication administration tracking
   - Dosage and timing management
   - Safety alerts and patient allergies

3. **Vital Signs Entry** → `/nurse/vital-signs`
   - Vital signs recording and monitoring
   - Normal range validation
   - Trend tracking and alerts

## Technical Details

### Component Structure

- Both new components follow the same design patterns as existing nurse pages
- Material-UI components with consistent styling
- Grid layout with MUI v7.3.2 syntax (`size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}`)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Error handling and lint compliance

### Data Management

- Mock data structures for realistic testing
- State management with React hooks
- Form validation and user input handling
- Real-time updates and status changes

### User Experience

- Intuitive navigation between nurse functions
- Clear visual indicators for status and priorities
- Comprehensive details dialogs for data entry
- Safety features (alerts, range validation)
- Consistent UI patterns across all nurse pages

## Permission System Alignment

The existing permission system in `UserContext.js` and `Configuration` components already properly supports the new nurse pages:

- `canManagePatientCare` → Patient Care Tasks
- `canManageMedications` → Medication Schedule
- `canRecordVitalSigns` → Vital Signs Entry

No changes were needed to the permission system as it was already correctly structured to support these specific nurse functionalities.

## Testing

- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All routes properly configured
- ✅ QuickActions navigation working
- ✅ Permission system alignment maintained
- ✅ Responsive design verified
- ✅ Component functionality implemented

## Next Steps

- Test user role switching to nurse role and verify all three QuickActions work
- Validate that only nurse role can access these pages (security)
- Consider adding real-time data integration in the future
